# MATLAB Base Images

This folder contains information about images configured to provide a MATLAB interactive workspace option in the Domino Data Lab platform.
Each folder contains a readme with details about where to find the image, what notebook properties to use when creating a Compute Environment within Domino, and any other notes specific to that image.
The readme files also contain information about the image each MATLAB image is based on, with references to those Dockerfiles where applicable.
These folders do not contain the Dockerfiles used to add the MATLAB software layers to the image; if you need this information for debugging or other purposes, please submit a support ticket by emailing support@dominodatalab.com.
